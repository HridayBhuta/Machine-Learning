# Machine Learning & Deep Learning Project

This repository contains a collection of projects and implementations in **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning**, covering **NLP, CNNs, XGBoost, and models built from scratch**.  

The goal of this project is to explore different paradigms of ML/DL — from classical algorithms to modern deep learning architectures — and compare their performance on real-world datasets.

## Features
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**  
  - Sentiment analysis / text classification models  

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**  
  - Image classification tasks  
  - Implementations using TensorFlow

- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**  
  - Implementation of GAN architecture 
  - Image generation tasks (e.g. MNIST) 

- **XGBoost**  
  - Gradient boosting for structured/tabular datasets  
  - Feature importance and interpretability  

- **Models from Scratch**  
  - Implementing ML/DL models without libraries (NumPy, Pandas only)  
  - Example: Single Layered Perceptron, Naive Bayes
